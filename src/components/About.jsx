    <h4>About me</h4>
    <p>
      Hello there! I’m Isabel, a passionate junior software developer
      with a good foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of programming, as well as a passion for building creative software.<br /><br />
      My journey into programming actually started in my early teenage
      years, tinkering and experimenting with code on the blogging
      platform Tumblr - and I could never really let go of the coding.<br /><br />
      I've had the chance to work in a range of different environments, both collaborating with large teams but also
      working more autonomously. My background isn't just in
      development – my experiences in service and design have given me
      a unique perspective that enhances my approach to software.
