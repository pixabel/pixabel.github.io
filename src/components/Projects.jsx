            AirportSimulator is a desktop application I built for
            my C# II class at Malm√∂ University, using C# and
            Windows Forms, simulating the operations of an airport
            in real-time. This project provides users with the
            ability to manage various aspects of airport activity,
            focusing on the scheduling and coordination of
            aircraft movements. <br /><br />
            <strong>Key Features:</strong> <br />
            Flight Scheduling: Users can simulate both takeoff and
            landing operations for multiple aircraft. <br />
            Aircraft Management: Allows tracking of multiple
            aircraft, including details such as model, flight
            number, origin, and destination. <br />
            Runway Utilization: The application efficiently
            manages runway availability, ensuring that no two
            aircraft are using the same runway simultaneously.
            <br />
            Time Simulation: Calculate and display estimated
            arrival times based on real-world data. <br />
            Emergency Handling: Simulate emergency landings and
            prioritize emergency flights. <br />
            Realistic Visual Representation: A simplified yet
            functional user interface simulates the flow of air
            traffic at an airport. <br />
            <br />
            This application serves as a demonstration of how
            object-oriented principles can be applied to simulate
            real-world systems. It showcases my skills in C#,
            event-driven programming, and design through the use
            of Windows Forms.

            This Python program is an interactive math-based game
            called "Math Zombies!" where players must solve math
            questions to avoid encountering zombies behind doors.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Here's an overview of its functionality:</strong> <br />
            - Question Generation: Based on the player's chosen
            operation (multiplication, division, or modulus),
            random math questions are generated. For
            multiplication, the user selects a table, while for
            division and modulus, a divisor is chosen. <br />
            - Gameplay: The player is asked to solve 12 randomly
            generated math questions. For each correct answer,
            they must choose one of several doors, behind which
            zombies may be hiding. The number of doors decreases
            as the player progresses, increasing the challenge.
            <br />
            - User Interaction: The player inputs their answers
            and door choices. If they solve all the questions
            correctly and avoid zombies, they win. Incorrect
            answers or bad door choices end the game. <br />
            - Replay Option: After each game, the player is asked
            if they want to play again. The program emphasizes
            user input validation, randomization for question
            generation, and a simple but fun storyline to engage
            users in solving math problems.
